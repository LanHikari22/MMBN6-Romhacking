        Depending on the method of initiating the GameFile, it will operate on different modes. A File defined based on
        purely a range, cannot have a unified 'filename' for example.

        :param args: Below is a list of different ways to instantiate a game file
        fromRange(start_ea, end_ea)
            Instantiates a Gamefile object based on the boundaries given. This will override any
            heuristics used to identify game files. The file is all elements within the specified boundary. Period.
            Mode: Mode.RANGE
            :param start_ea: (int) The absolute start address of the file;
            :param end_ea: (int) The absolute end address of the file
        fromName(fileName)
            A heuristic that assumes the file boundaries based on the defined name of the file. Other modules can
            perform their own logic and rename functions to indicate they belong to the same file.
            The filename specification is that all named items must begin with '<fileName>_'
            Mode: Mode.RANGE | Mode.NAME
            :param fileName: (str) The name of the file to scan for.
            :raises InvalidGameFileException This exception is raised when the fileName is detected in multiple
            places, but is cut by another fileName in the middle.
            For example: if there are two subroutines in a Battle GameFile, their names could be something like
            Battle_08040000 and Battle_08090000. The ea of the lowest Battle subroutine, and the highest one will be
            used, and linearly swept to determine the boundaries of the file.
            Function heads, location heads that are not within a function, and data heads from minEA to maxEA
            must have a name that begins with 'Battle_', or this exception will be raised.
        fromLocalName(search_ea, fileName)
            This combines the best worlds of the Name and EA modes. A name does NOT have to be global to
            the entire namespace. It only needs to be confined within a local region.
            Given a search_ea >= start_ea, the name of items within that region, and the whole region
            can be identified as a GameFile. Once the start_ea is identified, ea is advanced until a
            fail condition defines the end of the file.
            For example, if search_ea = 0, all names from address 0 will be searched until the naming
            scheme matches. The first time it matches is start_ea, then from then, the first time a
            non-match is detected, determines the end of the file.

            :param fileName: the name of the file that all items within
