Necessary changes to convert disassemblies in IDA:
1. remove ROM:%08X
2. Instructions liek MOVS, and SUBS are illegal. Replace with MOV, SUB
3. ';' is not  used by gcc for comments, replace with '//'...
4. After each label, add a ':'
5. Add the disassembly to a unique section to be linked: '.section .link__<name>, "ax"'

Steps to adding the disassembly to the project
1. Add to <name>.s in src
2. Modify romlink.ld to include .link__<name> as such: 
    . = <address of file>;
    .link__<name> : {*.o(.link__<name>)}
3. Modify symbols.x to include any dependencies found in the file (DOESNT WORK)
3.5 Include all dependencies in dependencies.s and dependencies.x
