0x01    u8          PET_naviSelect     
		Seems to only be valid from 0x00 to 0x0E.
		Changing this basically modifies the navi sprie near the PET icon        
0x03    u8          ?                  
0x04    u8          MapSelect          
		This changes both the map name when accessing PET, and when accessing a submenu, you find yourself
		in that map next!!
		>= 0x80 is the internet?! It actually triggers random battles while walking in the real world TOO
		but after coming back you'd be warped to the internet
		It is used as such: v2[MapSelect] + unk_05 where v2 = (int*)&0x803385C
		803385C seems to be pointing to map data to be loaded
0x05    u8          MapSubOffset       
		Seems to also be map selection related! values above 0x01 may crash? confirm
		It is used as such: v2[MapSelect] + off_05 where v2 = (int*)&0x803385C   
0x06    u8          gameProgress       
		Changes conversations for NPCs... Including L Message!!!          
0x07    u8          ?                  
0x08    u8          ?                  
		Seems to affect L-messages.
		> 0x03 crashes game when initiating L-msg?

0x0D    u8          ?                  
		Linked with offset 0x05 somehow? equated to it in sub_8005C04       
0x0E    u8          ?                  
0x0F    u8          bgMusicIndicator   
		Changing this and entering then exiting a subsystem changes background music
		But changing it alone is not enough to trigger music change          
0x10    u8          ?                  
0x11    u8          ?
